# Buble Sorting showed with Design patterns in Typescript.

*Brief info: In this small project used google maps with markers which show us generated data with coordinates and name of locations, main purpose of this project is that to show how working design patterns.*

1. Firstly install 2 modules [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) & [Concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently):<br>
 - Nodeman will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server when your code changes.<br>
 - Concurrently module will help us to run  many scripts.<br>
 
*Also be advised that in package.json in scripts field `tsc -w` will create compilation from TS to JS process but automatic*
```bash
npm i nodemon concurrently
```

2.And here we goo
```bash
npm start
```
